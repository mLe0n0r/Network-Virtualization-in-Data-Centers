\section{Introduction}
\paragraph{}
Nowadays, modern organizations rely on rapidly growing data centers that support high workloads. Therefore, the data center network must be able to isolate and move data loads, even scaling, without complicating the physical core of the networkâ€”that is, by modifying only the logical layer.\par
Traditional VLAN-based techniques do not provide sufficient capacity for today's service needs. Therefore, network overlays allow us to create logical virtual networks on an underlay (link layer), encapsulating traffic. Among the technologies considered are VXLAN and NVGRE, which may include Geneve.
